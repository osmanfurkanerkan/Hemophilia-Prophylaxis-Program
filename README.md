# Hemophilia-Prophylaxis-Program
This project is a Python program designed to calculate the necessary medication amounts for hemophilia patients eligible for prophylaxis treatment. It also generates statistical data regarding hemophilia patients based on the input data, including disease severity, medication type, and costs for treatment.

Features

Patient Data Input: The program allows the entry of essential data for hemophilia patients, such as identification number, name, disease type (Hemophilia-A or Hemophilia-B), factor protein deficiency, factor levels, and antibody presence.

Disease Severity Classification: Based on the factor levels, the program calculates and classifies the severity of hemophilia (Severe, Moderate, or Mild).

Prophylaxis Eligibility: The program determines whether a patient is eligible for prophylaxis treatment and calculates the necessary medication doses and frequency of administration.

Medication Calculation: It calculates the required medication (Factor-8 or Factor-9), the amount of medication needed per dose, and the types and quantities of vials required for treatment.

Medication Costs: The program calculates the total medication cost for 4-week prophylaxis and provides the total cost in dollars.

Statistical Analysis: After processing multiple patients, the program generates statistical data, including:
Number of Hemophilia-A and Hemophilia-B patients.
Percentages of patients with different severities.
Prophylaxis statistics, including medication types and costs.
Details of the highest medication amounts required by patients.


Getting Started
To run this project, you must have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python here.

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Hemophilia-Prophylaxis-Program.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd Hemophilia-Prophylaxis-Program
Make sure any required dependencies are installed (if any).

Usage
Run the Python script:
python hemophilia_prophylaxis.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to enter patient data and calculate the required treatment information.

After all patients' data is entered, the program will generate the necessary statistical information.

Example Output
Patient details, including ID number, name, disease type, severity, prophylaxis eligibility, medication details, and cost.
Statistical summary including the number of patients by disease severity, inhibitor presence, prophylaxis treatment status, and more.
